# capnkit
A scikit-learn persistence library using Cap'n Proto serialization protocol.

**Note: If you're loading back into scikit-learn from Cap'n Proto files you will only be able to use transform methods. The focus of this library in the near term is to simply provide a way to deploy models into a "production environment".
